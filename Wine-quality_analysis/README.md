			WINE QUALITY ANALYSIS


This directory contains my work on analysing two wine qualit dat sets.

It covers:

	(i) How to upload CSV files to Jupyter Notebook
	(ii) How to assess data through various examples:
		-Number of samples in each dataset
		-Number of columns in each dataset
		-Features with missing values
		-Duplicate rows in the white wine dataset
		-Number of unique values for quality in each dataset
		-Mean density of the red wine dataset
